Lum OS provides essential functionality without the bloat of traditional desktop operating systems.

## Key Features

* Minimal Resource Usage: Efficient on systems with limited RAM and processing power
* Open Source: Fully open-source project available on GitHub
* Modular Design: Clean, modular architecture for easy customization
* Cross-Platform: Initially targeting x86\_64 architecture

## System Requirements

### Minimum

* CPU: x86 compatible processor
* RAM: 64 MB
* Storage: 100 MB available disk space
* Graphics: VGA compatible display adapter

### Recommended

* CPU: x86\_64 processor
* RAM: 256 MB or more
* Storage: 1 GB available disk space
* Graphics: SVGA compatible display adapter

## Installation

### From Source Code

Prerequisites:

* Linux-based environment (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
* GCC, NASM, QEMU, GRUB, xorriso, Git

Build Instructions:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/lum-os/lum-os.git
cd lum-os

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian example)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential nasm qemu-system-x86 grub-pc-bin xorriso git

# Build system
make build    # Compile kernel and bootloader
make iso      # Generate bootable ISO
make run      # Test in QEMU
```

### From Pre-built ISO

Pre-built ISO releases will be available in future versions via GitHub releases.

## Getting Started

### First Boot

1. Boot system or VM, select Lum OS from GRUB
2. System loads minimal kernel

### Current Development Status

* Basic Boot System: GRUB-based bootloader
* Minimal Kernel: Core functionality
* Build System: Compilation toolchain
* User Interface, File System, Device Drivers, Application Framework: In development

## Virtual Machine Setup

### QEMU

```bash
make run
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom lum-os.iso -m 256M
qemu-system-i386 -cdrom lum-os.iso -m 256M -netdev user,id=net0 -device e1000,netdev=net0
```

### VirtualBox / VMware

Configure a new Linux VM with 256 MB RAM and mount ISO.

## Usage Guide

Current Functionality:

* System boot via GRUB
* Minimal kernel loading
* Basic hardware detection

Planned Features:

* Command Line Interface
* File System support
* Memory and Process Management
* Graphical Interface
* Basic Applications
* Hardware and Gaming/Multimedia support

## Troubleshooting

* Boot Issues: Check BIOS/UEFI and VM settings
* VM Performance: Increase RAM, enable acceleration
* Build Problems: Verify dependencies, GCC/NASM versions, disk space

## Getting Help

1. Review documentation
2. Check GitHub issues
3. Join discussions or forums
4. Report bugs with system details and reproduction steps

## Development and Contributions

Contributions welcome:

* Code: pull requests
* Documentation: improve guides
* Testing: test releases
* Translation: internationalization efforts

## Roadmap

* Short Term: basic kernel, CLI, file system, device drivers
* Medium Term: GUI, application environment, networking, enhanced hardware support
* Long Term: stable release, application ecosystem, advanced multimedia, multi-architecture support

## Community and Support

* GitHub repository for issues and documentation
* Forums for discussion (planned)

## License

Lum OS is open-source. See LICENSE file for details.

## Conclusion

Lum OS is a lightweight OS for modern needs on modest hardware. It is under active development, and contributions and feedback are encouraged. The guide will be updated regularly with new features.
